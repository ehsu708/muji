	<p>MUJI is a Japanese lifestyle consumer store that has in-person shops as well as online ordering services. Many of their products areÂ  minimalistic, ergonomically designed, and portable. Muji offers a variety of goods, such as clothing, stationary, kitchenware, furniture, and toiletries.</p>
	<h2>The Target Audience</h2>
	<p>The target audience is largely young and trendy. Their simplistic yet well thought out design seems to also appeal to those who are themselves design oriented. It's likely that these consumers are motivated by usability, and a certain alternative demographic. Consumers are likely to have spare money to spend on higher quality items, and therefore are aimed towards younger working adults, who come from a middle to upper middle class economic standing. A t-shirt is sold for $10.00, and prices go up from that.</p>

	<p>Consumers of MUJI like design for themselves, whether it be interior design, artistic or graphic design, or product design. They can be very driven by product appearance and aesthetic. As MUJI is originally a Japanese brand, consumers are likely familiar with the global implications of the company, and may have had more opportunity to travel, whether it be to Asia or to New York City, where the first branch of MUJI US opened. As we are analyzing the MUJI website, it makes sense for consumers to have been led to the website by ads, word-of-mouth, or have already been well established with the brand.</p>
	<p>Some consumer concerns would be functionality of these products, how well the website demonstrates these functionalities, ease of purchase, speed of shipping, and shipping fee.</p>
