	<p><a href="http://www.muji.com/us/">MUJI</a> is a Japanese lifestyle consumer store that has in-person shops as well as online ordering services. Many of their products are  minimalistic, ergonomically designed, and portable. Muji offers a variety of goods, such as clothing, stationary, kitchenware, furniture, and toiletries.</p>
	<h2>The Target Audience</h2>
	<p>The target audience is largely young and trendy. Their simplistic yet well thought out design seems to also appeal to those who are themselves design oriented. It's likely that these consumers are motivated by usability, and a certain alternative demographic. Consumers are likely to have spare money to spend on higher quality items, and therefore are aimed towards younger working adults, who come from a middle to upper middle class economic standing. A t-shirt is sold for $10.00, and prices go up from that.</p>

	<p>Consumers of MUJI like design for themselves, whether it be interior design, artistic or graphic design, or product design. They can be very driven by product appearance and aesthetic. As MUJI is originally a Japanese brand, consumers are likely familiar with the global implications of the company, and may have had more opportunity to travel, whether it be to Asia or to New York City, where the first branch of MUJI US opened. As we are analyzing the MUJI website, it makes sense for consumers to have been led to the website by ads, word-of-mouth, or have already been well established with the brand.</p>
	<p>Some consumer concerns would be functionality of these products, how well the website demonstrates these functionalities, ease of purchase, speed of shipping, and shipping fee in comparison with other consumer shopping websites.</p>
	<h2>Website Personality</h2>
	<p>From first glance, the MUJI US page is very streamlined, professional, and organized. The page gives off the impression that MUJI is sincere in their product and design, likely due to the clear serif text and the white backdrop. However, when you move into the <a href="https://www.muji.us/store/?area=header">store page</a>, the effect is lost. The moving images and the "Important Announcement " unfortunately makes the webpage less static and louder to the perception.</p>

	<p>Still, MUJI keeps their website layout very organized, with clear division between one product and the next, making everything categorical. Therefore navigation-wise, the site is able to uphold a general personality related to organization and cleanliness.</p>

	<h2>Content Choices</h2>
	<p>MUJI  products are displayed simply, with white backdrops, on the landing page, and rarely presented on a model. The clothes and products speak for themselves when the user browses through the website.</p>

	<img src="muji2.png" alt="Muji Shirts" style = width:500px height:314px>

	<p>This likely keeps the design looking simplistic, and further emphasizes MUJI's brand. However, it does make some articles of clothing difficult to imagine for the user, and therefore does not allow a great determination of product utility.</p>

	<p>The text next to products adds to a cluttered feeling of the main landing page which, as a browser of the website, may deter someone from making a decision clearly.</p>
